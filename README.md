# JavaScript RBJ Color Game

This repository hosts a JavaScript project called RBG color game. This is guessing game where you need to choose what color is represented by random RBG number. It has 2 levels: easy and hard. In easy level you guess the color from 3 given options, hard level contains 6 options.

## What is RBG colours?

RGB color space or RGB color system, constructs all the colors from the combination of the Red, Green and Blue colors.
The red, green and blue use 8 bits each, which have integer values from 0 to 255. This makes 256*256*256=16777216 possible colors.

In this project I mastered: 
- working with HTML canvas
- CSS3 selectors and animation
- JavaScript logical operators, arrays, loops, nesting conditionals, events, higher order functions, multiple methods, code refactoring and more
- DOM manipulations
- sound implementation
